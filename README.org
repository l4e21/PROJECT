* PROJECT : A Minimalist Metaobject Protocol for PROLOG

I wrote this 'project' (a portmanteau of PROLOG and Object) because

1. I was tired of writing boilerplate over and over in PROLOG for what were essentially objects.

2. Logtalk doesn't support qsave very well, which I generally make extensive use of (DON'T WRITE DEAD SYSTEMS! Seriously).

3. I was frustrated by XPCE's lack of decent tooling, as well as its object system not being sufficiently introspective, as are many other declarative object systems.

4. I wanted something lightweight + easy to understand for an expert user.


A basic metaobject protocol is provided with inheritance, good integration with PROLOG, and a simple dispatch shell. An image is also provided. Memory is currently managed manually, but hopefully eventually I will add a garbage collector.
