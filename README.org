* PROJECT : A Minimalist Metaobject Protocol for PROLOG

I wrote this 'project' (a portmanteau of PROLOG and Object) because

1. I was tired of writing boilerplate over and over in PROLOG for what were essentially objects.

2. Logtalk doesn't support qsave very well, which I generally make extensive use of (DON'T WRITE DEAD SYSTEMS! Seriously).

3. I was frustrated by XPCE's lack of decent tooling, as well as its object system not being sufficiently introspective, as are many other declarative object systems.

4. I wanted something lightweight + easy to understand for an expert user.


This is about as simple as you can get IMO.
